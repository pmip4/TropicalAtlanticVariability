# Tropical Atlantic Variability
This repository holds some analysis performed by Chris Brierley, which will contribute to a manuscript by led by Ilana Wainer.

## Data

There are two sources of data being used here, although both come via the Climate Variability Diagnostics Package:
  - ATL3 time series computed directly by NCAR and downloaded from the [CVDP data repository](https://www.cesm.ucar.edu/projects/cvdp/data-repository).
  - ATL3 time series and spatial patterns after [Brierley & Wainer (2018)](https://cp.copernicus.org/articles/14/1377/2018/) computed from the PMIP4 archive of [Zhao et al](https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/15/2475/2022/gmd-15-2475-2022.html), with some added PlioMIP2 simulations.
